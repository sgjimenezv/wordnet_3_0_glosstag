<!--This is the wrapper for the contents of a gloss. 

	@desc="orig" means this contains a copy of the original WordNet
	gloss in the child <orig> tag.

	@desc="text" means this contains the tokenized text of the gloss
	in the child <text> tag.

	@desc="wsd" is assigned to disambiguated glosses. Minimally, this must
    contain a definition. It can be preceded by domain classification and/or
    auxiliary info (usually in parens, but not always), and optionally followed
    by more auxiliary info and zero or more examples. Contents of classif and
    aux (with the exception of verb arguments) are not sense-tagged. Only the 
    synset terms in ex's are sense-tagged.

-->

<!ELEMENT def (aux | wf | cf | mwf | qf)*>
<!ATTLIST def %id;>
<!-- Wraps the definition text. With the exception of the contents of aux with
     @tag="ignore", and stoplist words/collocations, all open class words

<!ELEMENT aux (wf | cf | mwf | qf)+>
<!ATTLIST aux tag (ignore) #IMPLIED
              type (arg)   #IMPLIED>
<!--This tag demarcates auxiliary info. <aux> contents are always secondary to
    the main sense of the synset. aux info generally precedes or follows the
    def, but can also be embedded within the def text. There are two kinds of
    auxiliary info, @tag="ignore" and @type="arg". Those assigned @tag="ignore"
    contain mainly grammatical or usage information, some qualifying text such
    as a year born, time period, or date range, or a chemical or other symbol.
    The contents of @tag="ignore" aux's are not sense-tagged. aux's that
    are assigned @type="arg" only appear in verb glosses, and contain
    the argument, or typical argument, for the preceding verb. They are set
    off in this way so that the syntax of the definition fits that of the
    lemma (defining verb is intransitive if the lemma is intransitive). The 
    contents of @type="arg" aux's are sense-tagged.

<!ATTLIST classif type (cat | use | reg | unk) #REQUIRED>
<!--This is a wrapper for domain classification info preceding a def. For
    the purposes of tagging/WSD, this text is "ignorable", as it is repeated
    in the usage, region, and category pointers for the synset. 

	The classification types for glosses are "cat" (domain category), "use"
    (usage), and "reg" (region). "unk" is for unknown.

<!ATTLIST id sk CDATA #REQUIRED
             lemma CDATA #REQUIRED
             coll CDATA #IMPLIED
			 %id;>
<!--id is the sense tag for the parent element (a wf or glob).

    The <id/> holds the sense key for the synset referenced in the @sk attribute,
    and the lemma form corresponding to the lexeme it refers to in @lemma.
    The lemma here is the WordNet entry form, without wn pos appended. Case
    is preserved so that it matches exactly the WordNet entry form (unlike
    on the sense key).

	@coll points to the collocation (ie, <glob> tag) that the <id> is the sense tag
	for. @coll on the <id> matches the @coll on <glob>.

    <id/>'s are assigned during sense-tagging, and will only exist for
    disambiguated words/collocations (that is, only words not within auxiliary
    text, or on the stoplist, or in example sentences when not a synset
    word/collocation).

    If a word or collocation is tagged to more than one sense, it will have
    more than one id, one id per sense tag.

<!--mwf's delimit multi-word forms belonging to a number of semantic classes,
    which were automatically assigned during preprocessing. The class is
    indicated by the value in the mwf's @type attribute. All or part of the
    mwf may be sense tagged to WordNet entry words/collocations.

Attributes:

type="date" indicates the mwf is a date.
type="drange" indicates the mwf is a date range.
type="nrange" indicates the mwf is a numeric range other than a (recognizable) date.
type="num" indicates the mwf is a numeric form.
type="time" indicates the mwf is a time.
type="curr" indicates the mwf is currency.
type="meas" indicates the mwf is a measurement.
type="math" indicates the mwf is a formula or other mathematical form.
type="other" indicates other multi-word forms (eg., groupings of symbols).

			 %id;>
<!--A wf is a single-word form (or punctuation) that is not part of a
    WordNet collocation.

    @lemma contains all potential lemmas for the orthographic form, where the
    lemma is the WordNet entry form of the word with wn pos appended (eg.
    the form "flies" has 3 potential lemmas: the noun fly, the verb fly, and
    the noun flies, hence, @lemma="flies%1|fly%1|fly%2"). 

    Neither @lemma nor <id/> are required (as @type="punc" wfs do not get
    assigned a lemma, and not all wfs are sense-tagged). @lemma remains
    unchanging for the duration of the auto/manual sense tagging phases.

    @sep contains the character separating this wf from the next in print. Valid
    values for the @sep attribute are "-", "", and " ", for hyphenated words not
    in wn, cases where no space follows the <wf>, and the default case,
    respectively. The default value for @sep is a space, not explicitly assigned.

    @type is assigned to wf's that are punctuation, abbreviations, acronyms,
    or belong to one of a small set of semantic classes listed below.

	@pos was automatically assigned to wf/cfs within <def> only.

Attribute values for tag:

tag="un" indicates the wf has not been sense-tagged (ie, is untagged)
tag="auto" indicates the wf was automatically disambiguated
tag="man" indicates the wf was manually disambiguated
tag="ignore" indicates that the wf is to be ignored during disambiguation

Attribute values for type:

type="punc" indicates the wf is punctuation.
type="year" indicates the wf is a year.
type="chem" indicates the wf is a chemical name.
type="num" indicates the wf is a number.
type="time" indicates the wf is a time.
type="math" indicates the wf is mathematical symbol, variable, etc.
type="symb" indicates the wf is a symbol.
type="curr" indicates the wf is currency.
type="abbr" indicates the wf is an abbreviation.
type="acronym" indicates the wf is an acronym.

Pos values (a variation on Penn Treebank's tagset):

(		open paren
)		close paren

<!ELEMENT cf (#PCDATA | glob)*>
<!ATTLIST cf tag (un | ignore) #REQUIRED
             lemma CDATA #IMPLIED

             type (punc | year | chem | num | time | symb | curr | math | abbr | acronym) #IMPLIED

             sep CDATA #IMPLIED
			 %id;>
<!--A cf is a wf that is a collocation form, i.e., it is part of a WordNet collocation.
    A collocation may be contiguous or non-contiguous. All cf's for the same collocation
    are linked together via the @coll attribute. The "head" cf (i.e., the first word
    in the collocation) is the form that gets assigned the sense tag (which
    is a child of the <glob> tag corresponding with that collocation). Thus,
    the sense tag is not an immediate child of <cf>, it is a descendant of it.

    Neither @lemma nor <glob/> are required (as @type="punc" cfs do not have
    a lemma, and non-head cfs do not bear the <glob/> tag, unless they
    are ALSO the head cf of another collocation). @lemma remains unchanging
    for the duration of the auto/manual sense tagging phases.

    The @coll attribute is required for all cfs, and contains a unique alpha
    character that identifies all cf's belonging to the same collocation. If
    the cf is a form in more than one collocation, @coll will contain a
    comma-delimited list of alpha chars. @coll values are unique
	within a gloss, that is, they start over with "a" for each gloss.
    
    @sep contains the character separating this cf from the next in print. Valid
    values for the @sep attribute are "-", "'", and "", for hyphenated words not
    in wn, contractions that get split, and cases where no space follows the <cf>,
    respectively. The default value for @sep is a space, not explicitly assigned.

	@pos was automatically assigned to wf/cfs within <def> only.

	Since the <glob> tag carries sense tag info, the @tag attribute on the cf does
	not indicate man or auto.

Attribute values for tag:

tag="un" indicates the cf was not disambiguated on its own (ie.,
	independent of the collocation)
tag="ignore" indicates the cf is a stoplist item

See wf for values for @type and @pos.

<!--
    Bears the lemma and sense tag info for a collocation. The @glob attribute
    indicates whether the collocation was automatically or manually globbed.

    @tag indicates if the glob has been sense-tagged, and if so, whether
    it was sense-tagged automatically or manually.

    @coll is the alpha identifier for the collocation to which this lemma
    and sense tag "belongs". All cfs for a collocation will reference this
    value in the cf's @coll attribute.

    If the collocation has been sense tagged, it will contain one or more
    <id/> children, one for each sense tag.
